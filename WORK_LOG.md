| November 20 | 10:40 - 11:10 | I thought about how to approach the problems set where if we have long string of 1's and 0's then we can put an identifier to tell us how many of them are coming in a row. We can have two bit identifiers with one bit representing if the bits behind correspond to 0 or 1. And the other corresponding to if we want to expand or compress. |
| November 20 | 11:10 - 11:40 |                                        I worked on coding the compress function I have a for-loop going the length of the text and then I check if each bit is the current bit. If it is we add to the sequence otherwise we write the length. If not then we reset the consecutive sequence variable to one and write the old one to the file. |
| November 21 |  5:15 - 5:45  |                            I updated the compress method to to write the run lengths and values to the output.  I wrote the expand method to decode the compressed data, recreating the original bitmap by repeating each bit for its specified length. Still think its not quite their and will now try and put limits for how long to encode. |
